# Credit_Score_Classification
This jupyter notebook is all about the classification models applied In the classification credit scores as good bad and standard.
The Models used here are support vector machines and random forest classifiers.
The grod searchsearch CV can br used in the model like SVM for stregthening the model and for better accuracy but simce the data set is huge wtith 100000 variables,with 5 or 10 cross validation folds,it is time consuming
Hence,i have not included the griod search cv hyperparameter tu ing for this model here,but it is recommended to use these boosting algos to improvose the model accuracy.
The accuracy gained  with random forest classifier is 79.8% which is pretty good and efficient accuracy to predict the unseen dataset.
